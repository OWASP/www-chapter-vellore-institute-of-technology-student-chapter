# OWASP Vellore Institue of Technology Student Chapter

## About Us
The **OWASP VIT Student Chapter** was formed in 2016 and ever since itâ€™s had one aim only, **spreading awareness about cyber security and malware** as well as ransomware threats in society and circles of students and teaching them how to deploy counter measures through various events and undertakings.

## Activities
We majorly indulge in sharing our knowledge through our blogs (both on Medium as well as on Blogger) and CTFs, spreading cybersecurity awareness with our weekly news, infographics, quiz, and instagram reels, conduct various events like CTFs, hackathons, webinars, workshops, open-quiz, along with various other cybersecurity events and most importantly learn together and contribute to the open-source community with our projects.

## Where we've come
With a strength of more than 100 active contributors, we have actually mentored more than 1500 students, completed 4 projects, and successfully conducted more than 50 events in our community of more than 750 members. Our organization stands with a Chapter Leader, Chapter Manager, Secretary and the sub-ordinating heads of various departments (Technical, Web-development, Design, and Operations). Each member is assigned certain roles and they regularly contribute for the development and growth of the chapter. Together, we work together to come together to fulfil our primary purpose - to spread awareness about cyber security.

 **Stay Updated, Stay Safe!**
