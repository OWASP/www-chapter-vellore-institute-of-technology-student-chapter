## Welcome
The [OWASP VIT Student Chapter](https://owaspvit.com) was formed in 2016 and ever since itâ€™s had one aim only, spreading awareness about cyber security and malware as well as ransomware threats in society and circles of students and teaching them how to deploy countermeasures through various events and undertakings. 

We majorly indulge in sharing our knowledge through our blogs (both on [Medium](https://medium.owaspvit.com/) as well as on [Blogger](https://blog.owaspvit.com/)) and CTFs, spreading cybersecurity awareness with our weekly news, infographics, quiz, and instagram reels, conduct various events like CTFs, hackathons, webinars, workshops, open-quiz, along with various other cybersecurity events and most importantly learn together and contribute to the open-source community with our projects.
With a strength of more than 100 active contributors, we have actually mentored more than 1500 students, completed 4 projects, and successfully conducted more than 50 events in our community of more than 750 members. Our organization stands with a Chapter Leader, Chapter Manager, Secretary and the subordinating heads of various departments (Technical, Web-development, Design, and Operations). Each member is assigned certain roles and they regularly contribute to the development and growth of the chapter.
